# simple-clock

This is a simple clock using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

It can be used to any project only by adding a div into the HTMl in the place where we want our clock to appear and add the JS code and styling to it.

To see the clock you should use Node and live-server and run the command 'npm run start'.
