Clock construction

The only thing we write inside the HTML is a div with an id of ‘clock’ in the particular place we want our clock to appear on screen. 
The rest exist in the JS code.

The Date object is a JavaScript object that represents the date and time. Inside the object, the date is stored as a number in milliseconds since 1st January 1970.
To create the Date object, we use the Date constructor. Creating a new Date object will return the current date and time. 
The output will change depending on our locale.
This Date object has multiple methods on it. These methods are used to extract different values from the object. For example, to extract the hour from the object, we have a method called getHours().
Similarly, getMinutes() method will give us the minutes, and the getSeconds() will provide the seconds. Another thing to note while using Date object is that it'll return the hour in 24-hour format.

To that we can add diferent characteristics for example if we want to change the 24-hour clock to a 12-hour clock.
let period = 'AM';
if (hours === 0) {
hours = 12;
}
if (hours > 12) {
hours = hours - 12;
period = 'PM';
}

And in the end we set the innerText of the clock to be a template literal containing all the new information we added:
const clock = document.querySelector('#clock');
clock.innerText = `${hours} : ${minutes} : ${seconds} ${period}`;

At the end we should call our clock using setInterval 
setInterval(clockTicking, 1000);
